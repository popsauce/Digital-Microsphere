# Week 1
## Main Objectives

* Work on the embryo image extraction step (2.2.1)
* Tweak and test different hsv value based ROI extraction (2.2.3)

## Highlights

Tested and modified boilerplate code compared results with different stages of embryo images. 

Would probably have to tweak this further for different images present in the dataset. 

Most of the techniques work better for images with more contrast between the embryo and the background, hence modifying hsv values is an important part to get more accurate contours and images.
